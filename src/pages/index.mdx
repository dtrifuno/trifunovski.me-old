# Hi, my name is Darko.

I am a full-stack software engineer currently based in Skopje, North Macedonia.

## Background

Previously, I was a graduate student in the [Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science](https://mscs.uic.edu/)
at the [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://www.uic.edu), where I got my PhD in December 2019.

I am interested in all aspects of web development, but I am especially passionate about building applications driven by machine learning. You can read more about my recent projects on my [portfolio page](/projects) or my [Github profile](https://github.com/dtrifuno).

## Tools

On the back-end, I prefer using Python with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) or [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) when building REST APIs,
and TypeScript with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) when working with GraphQL.
I also have some experience with Java and the [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/). My favorite databases are [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for structured data, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as a document store and [Redis](https://redis.io/) for session data.

For front-end development, I mostly use [React](https://reactjs.org/) (especially with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/) projects), but I am also proficient with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

## Opportunities

I am interested in transitioning to a full-time position. If you have a job opening for which you think I might be a good match, please feel free to [email me](mailto:dtrifuno@gmail.com).
